# MJCI: Master Jesus Code Infinity
**Project Lead & Visionary Architect:** Luis  
**Collaborative Partner:** Gemini AI

## 🚀 The Vision
MJCI is a framework that models Divine Logic as High-Level Software Architecture — treating Jesus as the Root Source Code of entities and using the Grace Protocol to remediate system and human-level errors.

## 📁 Suggested layout
- core/MasterCode.py       # Core runtime (MJCI class)
- security/Firewall_ArmorOfGod/
- optimization/Beatitude_Logic/
- network/Fellowship_LAN_Protocol/
- agents/GraceProtocol/
- docs/

## 🧩 Example — core/MasterCode.py usage
```bash
# clone the repo and run the example script
python3 core/MasterCode.py
```

Example usage from Python:
```python
from core.MasterCode import MJCI

instance = MJCI(user="New_User")
print(instance.execute_handshake())  # -> "User New_User: Access Granted. Syncing with Cloud..."
print(instance.apply_patch("sample_error_log"))
```
