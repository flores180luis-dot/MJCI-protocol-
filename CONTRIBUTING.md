# Security Policy

Thank you for caring about security. This document explains how to report security vulnerabilities for MJCI.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately so maintainers can respond and coordinate a fix.

Preferred contact:
- Security email: security@flores180lui@icloud.com

When reporting, include:
- A concise summary of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce (POC if possible).
- Affected versions / components.
- Impact assessment and suggested mitigation (if known).

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

## Supported versions

List versions actively maintained and receiving security fixes here (e.g., v1.0.x). Update this section as the project matures.

## Disclosure policy

- We follow responsible disclosure: maintainers will coordinate a fix before public disclosure.
- If a fix is not available within a reasonable time window and the reporter wishes to disclose, please coordinate with maintainers.

## Third-party dependencies

- Keep third-party dependency versions pinned in requirements files.
- Report any supply-chain issues discovered in dependencies to maintainers via the above contact.

If you need an encrypted channel for sensitive data, request a PGP key (provide a key fingerprint or contact method).
